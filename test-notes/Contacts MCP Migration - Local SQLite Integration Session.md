# Contacts MCP Migration - Local SQLite Integration Session

**This is the continuity prompt for implementing local SQLite database integration with the completed Contact MCP TypeScript server.**

## Current Achievement Status: FEATURE COMPLETE âœ…

**Repository:** https://github.com/pdxmph/contact-mcp-ts  
**Local Development:** `/Users/mph/code/contact-mcp-ts`  
**Status:** 24 total tools implemented (120% of target), Basic Memory integration complete, MockD1Database enhanced with perfect data consistency

## Session Objective: Local Production Deployment

Implement **"Local Deployment First Strategy"** as documented in:
`memory://basic-memory/contacts-mcp-local-deployment-first-strategy`

### Strategy Context
Following the original project plan for **dual deployment modes**:
- âœ… **stdio transport** â†’ Claude Desktop access (current target)
- ðŸŽ¯ **HTTP transport** â†’ Future cloud deployment

**Approach:** Integrate with existing SQLite database directly rather than forcing cloud migration.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: SQLite Database Integration
1. **Analyze existing SQLite schema** â†’ Map to Contact MCP interface
2. **Create SQLiteContactDatabase class** â†’ Replace MockD1Database
3. **Update server configuration** â†’ Use real database
4. **Test all 24 tools** â†’ Validate against real data
5. **Configure Claude Desktop** â†’ Enable MCP access

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation  
1. **Verify tool functionality** â†’ All contact operations working
2. **Test Basic Memory integration** â†’ Conditional tools operational
3. **Performance validation** â†’ Ensure responsiveness with real data
4. **Documentation update** â†’ Local deployment instructions

## Required Information to Start

### 1. SQLite Database Schema
Please provide the output of:
```sql
.schema
```
from your existing SQLite contact database.

### 2. Database Location
What is the file path to your SQLite database?
(e.g., `/Users/mph/contacts.db`, `~/Documents/contacts.sqlite`, etc.)

### 3. Sample Data Preview (Optional)
If possible, a quick look at a few sample records to understand data format:
```sql
SELECT * FROM contacts LIMIT 3;
```

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Schema Mapping Approach
1. **Direct field mapping** where possible (name, email, phone, etc.)
2. **Data transformation** for field differences
3. **Default values** for missing fields in existing data
4. **Backward compatibility** preservation

### ContactDatabase Adaptation
- Keep same interface as current `ContactDatabase` class
- Replace D1-specific SQL with SQLite-compatible queries  
- Maintain all 24 tool functions without changes
- Preserve error handling and validation

### Development Workflow
- Maintain excellent hot reloading environment
- Keep MockD1Database for testing when needed
- Environment variable to switch between SQLite/Mock modes
- All existing testing tools continue to work

## Expected Outcomes

**Immediate Benefits:**
- âœ… Real contact management via Claude Desktop
- âœ… All 24 tools working with actual data
- âœ… Basic Memory integration with real contacts
- âœ… No disruption to existing contact workflow

**Technical Validation:**
- Complete TypeScript migration proven with real data
- Production readiness demonstrated
- Foundation for future HTTP/cloud deployment established

## GitHub Issues for Implementation

**Next Issue to Create:**
- **Issue #8:** Local SQLite Database Integration
  - Replace MockD1Database with SQLite adapter
  - Schema mapping and data transformation
  - Local production deployment testing

**Future Issues:**
- **Issue #9:** HTTP Transport Implementation (optional)
- **Issue #10:** Cloud Deployment Enhancement (optional)

## Development Guidelines

When implementing SQLite integration:
1. Treat vibe_check as a critical pattern interrupt mechanism
2. ALWAYS include the complete user request with each call
3. Specify the current phase (planning/implementation/review)
4. Use vibe_distill as a recalibration anchor when complexity increases
5. Build the feedback loop with vibe_learn to record resolved issues

## Success Criteria

- [ ] SQLite database successfully integrated
- [ ] All 24 tools working with real contact data
- [ ] Basic Memory integration operational with actual contacts
- [ ] Claude Desktop MCP access configured and functional
- [ ] Performance acceptable with real data volume
- [ ] Documentation updated for local deployment

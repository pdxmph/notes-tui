# Contacts MCP Migration: Continuity Prompt for Stage 1.3

## Project Context

You are continuing work on the **Contacts MCP Migration Project** - migrating contacts-mcp from Go implementation (Claude Desktop/Code only) to TypeScript + Cloudflare Workers (enabling Claude.ai web/mobile access).

**Repository:** https://github.com/pdxmph/contact-mcp-ts

## Current Status: Ready for Stage 1.3

### âœ… Completed Stages

**Stage 1.1: Go Implementation Analysis (COMPLETE)**
- **GitHub Issue:** [#1](https://github.com/pdxmph/contact-mcp-ts/issues/1) 
- **Status:** All 22 MCP tools analyzed and documented
- **Key Output:** Comprehensive Go implementation analysis in `memory://projects/contacts-mcp-v2/go-implementation-analysis-contacts-mcp`
- **Findings:** Sophisticated contact management system with optimized SQLite database, Basic Memory integration, and advanced features like @mention system

**Stage 1.2: TypeScript MCP SDK Exploration (COMPLETE)**
- **GitHub Issue:** [#2](https://github.com/pdxmph/contact-mcp-ts/issues/2)
- **Status:** SDK research complete, prototype built, migration strategy documented
- **Key Outputs:**
  - TypeScript SDK research: `memory://projects/contacts-mcp-v2/typescript-sdk-research-analysis`
  - Migration strategy: `memory://projects/contacts-mcp-v2/migration-strategy-22-go-tools-to-typescript-sdk`
  - Working prototype: `/Users/mph/code/contact-mcp-ts` (3 tools implemented)
- **Key Finding:** Migration is HIGHLY FEASIBLE with 70% code reduction and significant DX improvements

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Task: Stage 1.3 Cloudflare Infrastructure Research

**GitHub Issue:** [#3](https://github.com/pdxmph/contact-mcp-ts/issues/3)

## Stage 1.3 Objectives

Research Cloudflare Workers infrastructure for MCP deployment to complete the technical foundation before beginning implementation.

### Research Areas
1. **Cloudflare Workers MCP Deployment Patterns**
   - Workers runtime constraints and capabilities for MCP servers
   - HTTP/SSE transport implementation for MCP protocol
   - Streamable HTTP transport setup for Workers
   - Performance considerations and limitations

2. **Cloudflare D1 Database Integration**
   - D1 capabilities for contact management workloads
   - SQLite compatibility assessment (current Go uses SQLite)
   - Query performance and optimization patterns
   - Multi-user data isolation approaches
   - Schema migration strategies from SQLite to D1

3. **Authentication & Multi-User Support**
   - OAuth integration options for Claude.ai compatibility
   - User isolation and security patterns
   - Environment variables and secrets management
   - Bearer token replacement strategies

4. **Deployment & Operations**
   - CI/CD pipeline setup for Workers
   - Environment configuration management
   - Monitoring and logging strategies
   - Error handling and debugging approaches

### Key Questions to Answer
- How do MCP servers deploy to Cloudflare Workers?
- What are the runtime constraints for TypeScript MCP SDK on Workers?
- How does D1 handle the contact management schema and query patterns?
- What OAuth providers/patterns work best for Claude.ai integration?
- How to implement per-user data isolation for multi-tenant deployment?
- What are the performance characteristics compared to local SQLite?

## Context from Previous Stages

### Current Go Implementation Strengths (Must Preserve)
- **22 sophisticated MCP tools** with advanced contact management
- **Optimized database schema** with relationship-aware thresholds
- **Basic Memory integration** - critical unique feature to maintain
- **@mention system** for natural log linking
- **Performance optimizations** with composite indexes and connection pooling

### TypeScript SDK Benefits (Validated)
- **70% code reduction** for tool definitions vs manual Go JSON-RPC
- **Full type safety** with compile-time + runtime validation
- **Better developer experience** with IDE support and debugging
- **Built-in protocol compliance** vs custom implementation
- **Cloudflare Workers ready** with Streamable HTTP transport

### Migration Strategy (Documented)
- All 22 tools mapped to TypeScript SDK patterns
- Database schema directly portable (SQLite â†’ D1 compatibility)
- Basic Memory integration preservable with careful API mapping
- Estimated timeline: 3-4 weeks for full migration
- Risk level: Medium (primarily data migration)

## Deliverables for Stage 1.3

1. **Cloudflare Infrastructure Research Notes**
   - Workers MCP deployment patterns and constraints
   - D1 database capabilities assessment
   - OAuth integration approach recommendations

2. **Technical Architecture Plan**
   - Workers deployment strategy
   - Database design for multi-user support
   - Authentication and security approach
   - Performance optimization plan

3. **Risk Assessment Update**
   - Cloudflare-specific challenges and limitations
   - Mitigation strategies for identified risks
   - Performance benchmarking plan

4. **Stage 1 Completion Preparation**
   - After Stage 1.3, create comprehensive Architecture Decision Document
   - Set up Stage 2 (Core Functionality Migration) planning

## Development Guidelines

When working on this project:

1. **Treat vibe_check as a critical pattern interrupt mechanism**
2. **ALWAYS include the complete user request with each call**
3. **Specify the current phase (planning/implementation/review)**
4. **Use vibe_distill as a recalibration anchor when complexity increases**
5. **Build the feedback loop with vibe_learn to record resolved issues**

### GitHub Issue Management
- Use comments on Issue #3 to capture progress/continuity information
- Document key findings and decisions in issue comments
- Link to relevant Basic Memory notes for detailed documentation

### Documentation Strategy
- Create detailed research notes in Basic Memory under `projects/contacts-mcp-v2/`
- Include practical examples and code samples where relevant
- Focus on actionable insights for implementation decisions

## Next Steps After Stage 1.3

1. **Complete Stage 1:** Create Architecture Decision Document
2. **Plan Stage 2:** Core Functionality Migration (database + core tools)
3. **Setup Development Environment:** Cloudflare Workers + D1 development setup
4. **Begin Implementation:** Start with database layer and 2-3 core tools

## Key Success Criteria

- Comprehensive understanding of Cloudflare deployment requirements
- Clear technical approach for multi-user OAuth integration
- Validated D1 database approach for contact management workloads
- Actionable deployment and operations plan
- Confidence to proceed with Stage 2 implementation

# Contacts MCP Project Prompt

## Project Overview

Continue development of the Contacts MCP (Model Context Protocol) server in Go that allows Claude to manage personal contacts via native MCP tools. This project builds a comprehensive contact relationship management system with intelligent categorization and maintenance tracking.

### üö® CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

1. **‚ö†Ô∏è ALL CONTACT OPERATIONS MUST RESPECT RELATIONSHIP CATEGORIES**
   - **NO EXCEPTIONS** when moving contacts between groups
   - Relationship types are: `close`, `family`, `network`, `social`, `providers`, `recruiters`, `work`
   - Different overdue thresholds: 30 days (close/family/social/work) vs 90 days (network/providers/recruiters)
   - **Social group serves as "holding tank"** for people you know but don't actively maintain
   - This categorization is **NON-NEGOTIABLE** for maintaining contact organization

2. **üéØ DATABASE IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR CONTACTS**
   - SQLite database at `~/.contacts/contacts.db` contains authoritative contact data
   - All contact modifications go through MCP tools, not direct database access
   - When debugging, check database directly but modify through tools
   - **Database integrity is NON-NEGOTIABLE for contact management**

3. **üîÑ MANDATORY RESTART PROTOCOL** 
   - **WHEN YOU IMPLEMENT NEW TOOLS OR MODIFY EXISTING ONES:**
     1. Complete the implementation
     2. **IMMEDIATELY STOP** all other activity
     3. Tell the user: "Implementation complete. **Claude Desktop must be restarted** to register the new tool. Please restart Claude Desktop and return to test the [tool name] functionality."
     4. **DO NOT** try to test the tool until after restart
     5. **DO NOT** continue with other tasks until restart is confirmed

   - **WHEN A TOOL IS MISSING FROM AVAILABLE TOOLS:**
     1. **IMMEDIATELY STOP** and ask: "I don't see the [tool name] tool available. Can you confirm if it appears in your MCP tool list?"
     2. If user confirms it's missing: "The tool needs a restart to register. Please restart Claude Desktop and return to test the [tool name] functionality."
     3. **DO NOT** assume the tool will work without confirmation

### üöÄ Running the MCP

**Local (Claude Desktop):**

```bash
# Build the Go binary
cd ~/code/contacts-mcp
make build

# In Claude Desktop MCP settings:
{
  "contacts-mcp": {
    "command": "/Users/mph/code/contacts-mcp/contacts-mcp"
  }
}
```

**Remote (via mcp-remote proxy):**

```json
{
  "contacts-mcp-remote": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-remote", 
      "https://contacts.puddingtime.net/sse",
      "--auth-bearer",
      "wjXFrReUkZO0Z5fo0j4+hb5k+wd0EBQ/MluaebfsZ/s="
    ]
  }
}
```

**Production Deployment:**
- Code commits automatically trigger GitHub Actions build
- New images available at `ghcr.io/pdxmph/contacts-mcp:latest`
- Update Portainer stack to pull latest image
- Uses `docker-compose.prod.yml` configuration

### üí° Design Principles

**Contact Management Philosophy:**
- **Social group as "holding tank"** - Elegant solution for people you know but don't actively maintain
- **Relationship-based thresholds** - Different expectations for different relationship types
- **NULL date handling critical** - Must treat never-contacted as overdue, not current
- **Batch operations essential** - Single-contact operations don't scale for hundreds of contacts
- **Personal CRM approach** - Log observations and interactions for relationship context

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Go over Ruby** - Eliminated 500ms-1s startup overhead per operation
- **HTTP/SSE transport** - Enables remote access from any Claude instance
- **Bearer token auth** - Simple, secure authentication for remote access
- **Connection pooling** - Persistent SQLite connections for better performance
- **Unified queries** - Single optimized query instead of 7 separate queries for overdue contacts
- **Composite indexes** - Strategic indexes for common query patterns
- **WAL mode** - Better concurrent access for SQLite
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Professional deployment pipeline eliminates manual builds
- **Container registry approach** - Public packages for easy deployment

### üéØ **NEXT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

**Immediate Testing Opportunities:**
1. **Web Claude Integration Testing** - Verify bearer token auth works with Web Claude custom integrations
2. **Performance monitoring** - Add logging/metrics for remote service usage
3. **End-to-end validation** - Test all 18 tools through remote connection

**Future Feature Enhancements:**
1. **Gmail API Integration** (Issue #11) - Auto-update contact dates from email interactions
2. **Auto-discover Email Contacts** (Issue #12) - Automatically add new contacts from email history
3. **Contact deduplication tools** - Find and merge duplicate contacts
4. **Calendar integration** - Track meetings as contact interactions
5. **Contact export** - Generate formatted contact lists for external use
6. **Advanced filtering** - More sophisticated contact queries and reports
7. **Contact notes enhancement** - Rich note-taking with timestamps and categories

**Longer-term Vision:**
1. **Voice interface integration** - Much better UX for rapid contact management
2. **AI-powered categorization** - Suggest relationship types based on contact patterns
3. **Social media integration** - Pull in LinkedIn/other social data
4. **Contact lifecycle management** - Automated relationship maintenance suggestions
5. **Mobile companion** - Sync with mobile contact management
6. **Team/organization support** - Multi-user contact management with permissions

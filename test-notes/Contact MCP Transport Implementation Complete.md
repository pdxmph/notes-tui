# Contact MCP Transport Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented proper MCP request handling for issue #21 in pdxmph/contact-mcp-ts. The key fix was to actually call `server.request(body)` instead of returning "Method not implemented" for all requests.

## Key Discoveries
- StreamableHTTPServerTransport is Node.js-specific and incompatible with Cloudflare Workers
- The MCP SDK's `server.request()` method handles JSON-RPC protocol correctly
- Tools are automatically included in the initialize response by the MCP server
- Session management works with simple object storage and headers

## Implementation Details

### What Was Fixed
1. **Request Handling**: Changed from returning error to actually calling `server.request(body)`
2. **Session Management**: 
   - Generate session ID on initialize
   - Store MCP server instances by session ID
   - Use `Mcp-Session-Id` header for session tracking
3. **Logging**: Added console logging to debug initialize responses

### Code Changes in `src/worker-mcp.ts`
- Line ~360-395: Fixed MCP endpoint handler
- Initialize requests create new server and session
- Subsequent requests lookup existing server by session ID
- All requests now properly processed through `server.request()`

## Why Transport Approach Failed
The reference implementation suggested using `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`, but this class:
- Requires Node.js `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` types
- Is designed for Node.js HTTP servers, not Web APIs
- Cannot be adapted to Cloudflare Workers' Fetch API

## Current Implementation
```javascript
// Initialize request
const sessionId = crypto.randomUUID();
const server = createMcpServer(db);
servers[sessionId] = server;
const response = await server.request(body);

// Subsequent requests  
const server = servers[sessionId];
const response = await server.request(body);
```

## Tools Registered
1. `search_contacts` - Search by name, email, company, notes, label
2. `add_contact` - Create new contact with all fields
3. `get_contact` - Retrieve contact details with interactions
4. `mark_contacted` - Mark contact as contacted with interaction details

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
2. Test OAuth flow â†’ tools appearing in Claude.ai
3. Verify tool invocations work correctly
4. Consider adding remaining tools from Go implementation

# Contacts MCP Migration: Continuity Prompt for Stage 2

## Project Context

You are continuing work on the **Contacts MCP Migration Project** - migrating contacts-mcp from Go implementation (Claude Desktop/Code only) to TypeScript + Cloudflare Workers (enabling Claude.ai web/mobile access).

**Repository:** https://github.com/pdxmph/contact-mcp-ts
**Local Prototype:** `/Users/mph/code/contact-mcp-ts` (working TypeScript MCP server)

## ðŸŽ¯ Stage 2 Objectives: Core Functionality Migration

Migrate all 22 MCP tools from Go to TypeScript using the validated approach from Stage 1 research.

### 2.1 Database Schema Migration (Priority 1)

**Objective:** Port SQLite schema to Cloudflare D1 with multi-user support

**Database Design Approach:** Per-user D1 databases (recommended)
- Create separate D1 database per user
- Complete data isolation and security
- Up to 50,000 databases per Worker
- Dynamic database creation via Cloudflare API
- Direct SQLite schema compatibility

**Migration Tasks:**
1. **Design D1 Schema**
   - Port 4-table schema: `contacts`, `contact_interactions`, `logs`, `log_contacts`
   - Preserve composite indexes and optimization patterns
   - Add user isolation mechanisms
   - Implement schema versioning for future migrations

2. **Create TypeScript Data Access Layer**
   - D1 client integration with type safety
   - Query builders for complex contact operations
   - Transaction support for data consistency
   - Connection pooling and error handling

3. **Test CRUD Operations**
   - All contact management operations
   - Relationship-aware queries
   - Basic Memory integration preservation
   - Performance benchmarking vs Go SQLite

**Success Criteria:** 
- All database operations working with D1
- Performance within acceptable range of Go implementation
- Multi-user data isolation validated
- Basic Memory integration preserved

### 2.2 MCP Tools Implementation (Priority 1)

**Objective:** Port all 22 Go tools to TypeScript SDK patterns

**Tool Migration Strategy:**
- **3 tools already implemented** in prototype (search_contacts, get_contact, add_contact)
- **19 tools remaining** to migrate
- Use validated TypeScript patterns from Stage 1.2 research
- Preserve exact API compatibility with Go version

**Migration Priority Groups:**

**Group 1: Core Contact Management (Week 1)**
- `update_contact_info` - Update contact details
- `mark_contacted` - Record interaction with contact
- `set_contact_state` - Manage contact TODO states
- `delete_contact` - Remove contact from database
- `bulk_mark_contacted` - Batch interaction recording

**Group 2: Contact Discovery & Reporting (Week 2)**
- `list_overdue_contacts` - Find contacts needing follow-up
- `list_active_contacts` - Show contacts with TODO states
- `get_contact_stats` - System overview statistics
- `report_by_group` - Contact group analysis
- `suggest_tasks` - AI-driven follow-up suggestions

**Group 3: Relationship Management (Week 3)**
- `change_contact_group` - Move contacts between relationship types
- `update_contact_info` - Enhanced with relationship logic
- `get_contact` - Enhanced with relationship context

**Group 4: Logging & Integration (Week 4)**
- `add_log` - Create log entries with @mention parsing
- `list_logs` - Query log history
- `search_logs` - Full-text log search
- `get_contact_logs` - Contact-specific log history

**Group 5: Basic Memory Integration (Final Week)**
- `create_contact_note` - Generate Basic Memory notes
- `update_contact_note` - Sync database changes to notes
- `link_contact_note` - Associate existing notes
- `get_contact_note_url` - Retrieve note URLs

**Implementation Pattern (Per Tool):**
```typescript
// Example tool migration pattern
server.tool("tool_name", {
  description: "Tool description from Go implementation",
  inputSchema: zodSchemaFromGoStruct,
}, async ({ params }) => {
  // User authentication from OAuth context
  const userId = getUserFromAuth(props);
  const userDb = await getUserDatabase(userId);
  
  // Port Go logic to TypeScript
  const result = await implementGoLogic(userDb, params);
  
  // Return MCP-compatible response
  return {
    content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(result, null, 2) }]
  };
});
```

### 2.3 Local Development Setup (Priority 2)

**Objective:** Create development environment for TypeScript implementation

**Development Environment Components:**
1. **TypeScript Development**
   - Node.js environment with TypeScript
   - ESLint and Prettier configuration
   - Jest testing framework setup
   - VS Code debugging configuration

2. **Local D1 Database**
   - `wrangler d1` local development database
   - Schema migration scripts
   - Test data seeding capabilities
   - Database introspection tools

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Development vs. production configuration
   - Local secrets management
   - Hot reloading for development
   - Error handling and logging

**Development Workflow:**
1. Local TypeScript development with file watching
2. Local D1 database for testing
3. stdio transport testing with Claude Desktop
4. Unit tests for individual tools
5. Integration tests for tool combinations

## Critical Context from Stage 1

### Go Implementation Strengths (Must Preserve)
- **22 sophisticated MCP tools** with comprehensive contact management
- **Optimized database schema** with relationship-aware thresholds
- **Basic Memory integration** - critical unique feature
- **@mention system** for natural log linking
- **Performance optimizations** with composite indexes and connection pooling
- **State-based workflows** with TODO states (ping, invite, write, etc.)

### TypeScript SDK Benefits (Validated)
- **70% code reduction** for tool definitions vs manual Go JSON-RPC
- **Full type safety** with compile-time + runtime validation via Zod
- **Better developer experience** with IDE support and debugging
- **Built-in protocol compliance** vs custom implementation
- **Cloudflare Workers ready** with HTTP/SSE transport

### Cloudflare Architecture (Validated)
- **Per-user D1 databases** provide complete data isolation
- **Google OAuth integration** with Dynamic Client Registration
- **workers-oauth-provider** handles OAuth 2.1 compliance automatically
- **McpAgent class** manages transport and protocol complexity
- **128MB memory, 30s CPU time** sufficient for contact operations

### Migration Strategy (Documented)
- All 22 tools mapped to TypeScript SDK patterns
- Database schema directly portable (SQLite â†’ D1 compatibility)
- Basic Memory integration preservable with careful API mapping
- **Estimated timeline:** 3-4 weeks for full migration
- **Risk level:** Medium (primarily data migration complexity)

## Stage 2 Deliverables

### 2.1 Database Layer Complete
- D1 schema with multi-user support
- TypeScript data access layer with type safety
- All CRUD operations validated
- Performance benchmarked vs Go implementation

### 2.2 All 22 MCP Tools Migrated
- Complete tool parity with Go implementation
- Exact API compatibility maintained
- Basic Memory integration preserved
- @mention system and logging functional

### 2.3 Local Development Environment
- TypeScript development workflow established
- Local D1 database setup for testing
- Unit and integration test coverage
- Development vs production configuration

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Low Risks
- **Tool porting patterns** - Validated in prototype with 3 tools
- **TypeScript ecosystem** - Well-established, mature tooling
- **D1 SQLite compatibility** - Direct migration path confirmed

### Medium Risks
- **Complex tool logic** - Some tools have sophisticated relationship logic
- **Basic Memory integration** - Requires careful API preservation
- **Data migration testing** - Need comprehensive validation

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental approach** - Port tools in priority groups
- **Extensive testing** - Unit tests for each tool, integration tests for workflows
- **Parallel development** - Keep Go implementation running during migration
- **Rollback plan** - Can revert to Go implementation if issues arise

## Development Guidelines

When working on Stage 2:

1. **Treat vibe_check as a critical pattern interrupt mechanism**
2. **ALWAYS include the complete user request with each call**
3. **Specify the current phase (planning/implementation/review)**
4. **Use vibe_distill as a recalibration anchor when complexity increases**
5. **Build the feedback loop with vibe_learn to record resolved issues**

### GitHub Issue Management
- Create GitHub issues for each major component (database, tool groups)
- Use comments to capture progress and continuity information
- Link to relevant Basic Memory notes for detailed documentation

### Documentation Strategy
- Create detailed implementation notes in Basic Memory under `projects/contacts-mcp-v2/`
- Include code examples and migration patterns
- Focus on actionable insights for implementation decisions

# Contacts MCP - Local Deployment First Strategy

## Context

During the feature completion session, we clarified the **correct production deployment approach** based on the original project plan design for dual deployment modes.

## The Correct Approach: Local Deployment First

### Original Project Plan Design
The TypeScript SDK implementation was specifically designed to support **two deployment options**:

1. **Local via stdio** → Claude Desktop/Code access
2. **Remote via HTTP** → Claude.ai web/mobile access
   - Bearer token authentication (simple, guaranteed Claude Desktop access)
   - OAuth work kept in mind for future Claude.ai integration

### Why Local First Makes Sense

**✅ Immediate Value:**
- Work with existing SQLite database directly
- No data migration required
- Immediate Claude Desktop access to real contact data
- Zero infrastructure complexity

**✅ Practical Benefits:**
- Test with real data immediately  
- Validate all 24 tools against actual contact database
- Maintain existing workflow while adding MCP capabilities
- Gradual transition rather than forced migration

**✅ Future Flexibility:**
- HTTP transport can be added later
- Cloud deployment becomes optional enhancement
- Bearer token → OAuth migration path preserved

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: SQLite Integration (Next Session)**
1. Replace MockD1Database with SQLite adapter
2. Map existing schema to Contact MCP tools
3. Test locally with `node build/index.js`
4. Enable Claude Desktop access to real data

**Phase 2: HTTP Transport (Future)**
1. Add HTTP/SSE transport alongside stdio
2. Implement bearer token authentication
3. Deploy to personal server or cloud platform
4. Enable Claude.ai web/mobile access

**Phase 3: Cloud Enhancement (Optional)**
1. Migrate to Cloudflare Workers if desired
2. Implement OAuth for seamless Claude.ai integration
3. Scale as needed

## Technical Requirements for Next Session

### Information Needed
1. **SQLite Database Schema**
   ```sql
   .schema
   ```
2. **Database Location**
   - Path to existing SQLite file (e.g., `/Users/mph/contacts.db`)
   
3. **Schema Mapping Analysis**
   - Compare existing fields to our Contact MCP schema
   - Identify any data transformation needs
   - Plan field mapping strategy

### Implementation Plan
1. **Analyze Existing Schema** → Map to our ContactDatabase interface
2. **Create SQLiteContactDatabase** → Replace MockD1Database  
3. **Update Index.ts** → Use real SQLite database
4. **Test All Tools** → Verify against real data
5. **Configure Claude Desktop** → Enable MCP access

## Expected Benefits

**Immediate:**
- Real contact management via Claude Desktop
- Full 24-tool functionality with actual data
- No disruption to existing contact workflow

**Strategic:**
- Validates complete TypeScript migration
- Proves production readiness
- Establishes foundation for future cloud deployment

## Architecture Advantage

This approach leverages the **dual-mode design** correctly:
- **stdio transport** → Local production deployment  
- **HTTP transport** → Future cloud/web deployment

Rather than forcing cloud-first complexity, we get immediate production value with the simplest possible deployment while preserving all future options.

**Status:** Ready to implement SQLite integration for immediate local production deployment.

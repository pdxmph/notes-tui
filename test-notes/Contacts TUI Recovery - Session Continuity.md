# Contacts TUI Recovery - Session Continuity

## What Happened
During implementation of issue #17 (database initialization with -init flag), we successfully completed the feature but lost two previously implemented features due to a git rebase conflict:

1. **Issue #7 - Contact Style Feature** (edge case contact frequency)
2. **Scrolling Help Window**

## Current State
- Issue #17 is complete and pushed to main
- The -init flag works properly:
  - Creates ~/.config/contacts directory
  - Creates default config.toml
  - Initializes database with full schema
  - Adds sample contact
  - Shows helpful error when database missing

## Lost Features to Re-implement

### 1. Contact Style Feature (Issue #7)
Full implementation details are documented at: `memory://basic-memory/contact-style-feature-implementation-summary`

Key points:
- Added `contact_style` column (TEXT, default 'periodic')
- Added `custom_frequency_days` column (INTEGER, nullable)
- Three styles: periodic, ambient (∞), triggered (⚡)
- 'm' key to change contact style
- IsOverdue() method respects contact styles
- Visual indicators in list view

### 2. Scrolling Help Window
- Help text was made scrollable when too long to fit on screen
- Used viewport from Bubble Tea bubbles
- Allowed j/k navigation within help overlay

## Git History
- Current HEAD: 8c65e5a (has init feature but missing the other two)
- The features were implemented but lost during rebase from commit 605c6dc
- No stash or recovery branches exist with the lost code

## Next Steps
1. Re-implement contact style feature using the documented implementation
2. Re-implement scrolling help window
3. Test thoroughly before pushing

## Repository
- GitHub: pdxmph/contacts-tui
- Local: /Users/mph/code/contacts-tui

## Important Files to Modify
For contact style:
- internal/db/models.go (add ContactStyle and CustomFrequencyDays fields)
- internal/db/db.go (update queries to include new fields)
- internal/db/migrations.go (add migration for new columns)
- internal/tui/app.go (add 'm' key handler, style mode, visual indicators)

For scrolling help:
- internal/tui/app.go (convert help to viewport-based scrollable view)

**This is the continuity prompt for the Contacts MCP Migration Project - now ready for Stage 2.2: Tool Migration after completing all foundational work.**

Project Overview: Migrating contacts-mcp from Go implementation (Claude Desktop/Code only) to TypeScript + Cloudflare Workers (enabling Claude.ai web/mobile access) while maintaining exact API compatibility.

**Repository:** https://github.com/pdxmph/contact-mcp-ts  
**Local Development:** `/Users/mph/code/contact-mcp-ts` (4 tools working with enhanced development environment)

Current Status: **Ready for Stage 2.2 - Tool Migration (18 tools remaining)**

âœ… **COMPLETED STAGES:**
* **Stage 1:** Research & Architecture Review (100% complete) - All 3 research phases complete
* **Stage 2.1:** Database Schema Migration (100% complete) - Database foundation with D1 compatibility  
* **Stage 2.3 Phase 1:** Core Development Setup (100% complete) - Professional development environment

**Current Achievement:** Successfully completed all foundational work. Development environment now includes:
- âœ… Professional code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode)
- âœ… Hot reloading with nodemon for instant feedback
- âœ… Automated testing with Node.js test runner  
- âœ… Complete database layer with 4 working MCP tools validated

ðŸŽ¯ **STAGE 2.2 OBJECTIVE:** Migrate remaining 18 MCP tools from Go to TypeScript
* **Current Progress:** 4 of 22 tools complete (18% done)
* **Working Tools:** `search_contacts`, `get_contact`, `add_contact`, `mark_contacted`
* **Remaining:** 18 tools organized in 5 logical groups for systematic migration
* **Approach:** Incremental group-by-group migration maintaining exact API compatibility

**Why This Focus:** With database layer complete and excellent development environment operational, we can efficiently migrate remaining tools with hot reloading, automated testing, and code quality enforcement.

**Tool Migration Groups:**
* **Group 1: Core Contact Management** (4 tools remaining) - `update_contact_info`, `set_contact_state`, `delete_contact`, `bulk_mark_contacted`
* **Group 2: Contact Discovery & Reporting** (5 tools) - `list_overdue_contacts`, `list_active_contacts`, `get_contact_stats`, `report_by_group`, `suggest_tasks`  
* **Group 3: Relationship Management** (3 tools) - `change_contact_group` and enhanced relationship operations
* **Group 4: Logging & Integration** (4 tools) - `add_log`, `list_logs`, `search_logs`, `get_contact_logs`
* **Group 5: Basic Memory Integration** (4 tools) - `create_contact_note`, `update_contact_note`, `link_contact_note`, `get_contact_note_url`

**GitHub Issues:**
* **Current Issue:** #6 - Stage 2.2: MCP Tool Migration (4 Complete, 18 Remaining) - OPEN, ready for implementation
* **Supporting Issue:** #5 - Stage 2.3: Local Development Setup (Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Optional) - Phase 1 complete
* **Completed Foundation:** Issues #1-4 all complete (research, database, architecture)

**Development Environment Ready:**
* **Hot Reloading:** `npm run dev:hot` - instant feedback during development
* **Code Quality:** `npm run lint` and `npm run format` - automated code quality  
* **Testing:** `npm run test:build` - reliable test framework
* **Build:** `npm run build` - production-ready TypeScript compilation

**Migration Strategy:**
* Start with Group 1 (Core Contact Management) - most foundational operations
* Port Go logic to TypeScript maintaining exact API compatibility  
* Test each tool with Claude Desktop integration
* Use existing `ContactDatabase` class methods (already complete)
* Leverage TypeScript SDK patterns (70% code reduction vs Go)

**Development Guidelines:** Use vibe_check for pattern interrupts, update GitHub issue comments for continuity, maintain complete context for user requests. Create MCP tools using the established TypeScript SDK patterns with Zod schemas and exact Go API compatibility.

* **Migration Strategy:** `memory://projects/contacts-mcp-v2/migration-strategy-22-go-tools-to-typescript-sdk`  
* **Development Environment:** Enhanced with hot reloading, testing, code quality tools

**Continue with Stage 2.2: Tool Migration** - Foundation complete, ready for efficient systematic migration of remaining 18 tools! ðŸš€

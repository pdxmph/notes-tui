# Dusty Library Cocktail

## Recipe

- Mezcal
- Drambuie (small amount)
- Chocolate bitters
- Black salt rim (Hawaiian Black Sea salt or activated charcoal salt)

## Notes

- Also known as "Dusty Library" by some Kathleen and Amy
- Creates smoky, sweet, and slightly savory profile
- Black salt rim adds visual drama and mineral complexity
- Similar to Paper Plane or Oaxacan Old Fashioned variations
- Other possible names: "Black Magic" or "Obsidian"

## Flavor Profile

The combination of smoky mezcal, honeyed Drambuie, and chocolate bitters creates notes reminiscent of old books and leather - hence the "dusty library" name. The black salt rim provides mineral complexity that complements the earthy mezcal.

# Contact Style Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a hybrid approach to handle edge cases for contact frequency monitoring in the contacts-tui application. This allows contacts to have different monitoring patterns beyond the standard periodic checks.

## Database Changes
- Added `contact_style` column (TEXT, default 'periodic')
- Added `custom_frequency_days` column (INTEGER, nullable)
- Migration automatically sets all existing contacts to 'periodic' style

## Contact Styles
1. **periodic** - Regular cadence checking (default)
   - Uses relationship type defaults or custom frequency
   - Shows as normal in the list
2. **ambient** - Regular/automatic contact
   - Never shows as overdue
   - Shows with ∞ indicator in green
3. **triggered** - Event-based outreach
   - Never shows as overdue  
   - Shows with ⚡ indicator in yellow

## UI Changes
- Added 'm' key to change contact style
- Style selection overlay shows all three options
- For periodic style, prompts for custom frequency days
- Contact list shows visual indicators (∞ for ambient, ⚡ for triggered)
- Detail view shows contact style and frequency
- Help overlay updated with new keyboard shortcut

## Technical Implementation
- Updated `IsOverdue()` method to respect contact styles
- Added `UpdateContactStyle()` database method
- Created style selection mode with custom frequency input
- Added visual styles for ambient (green) and triggered (yellow) indicators
- Migration pattern follows existing approach for backwards compatibility

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Test changing contact styles with the 'm' key
2. Verify ambient and triggered contacts don't show as overdue
3. Test custom frequency input for periodic contacts
4. Ensure visual indicators display correctly
5. Verify contact style persistence across app restarts

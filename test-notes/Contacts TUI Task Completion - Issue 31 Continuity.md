# Contacts TUI - Task Completion Enhancement

## Session Summary
We implemented the enhanced TaskWarrior completion flow for issue #31 in pdxmph/contacts-tui.

## What We Completed
- Task completion form with multi-line textarea (appears when pressing Enter on a task)
- TaskWarrior annotations for completion notes
- Contact interaction logging with "task" type
- Clean formatting: `Completed task "Task Description": Note`
- Fixed textarea focus and input handling issues

## Still TODO
## Still TODO
- ✅ **State update prompt**: After task completion, optionally prompt to update contact state (e.g., "followup" → "ok") - IMPLEMENTED

## Latest Implementation (2025-06-18)
Added state update prompt that appears after task completion:
- Checks if contact's state is "followup", "write", "ping", or "scheduled"
- Shows modal prompt asking if user wants to update state to "ok"
- User can press 'y' to confirm or 'n'/Esc to skip
- Updates database and refreshes contact list if confirmed
- Shows success message after state update

Build completed successfully. Ready for user testing.
## Links
- **Issue**: https://github.com/pdxmph/contacts-tui/issues/31
- **Last commit**: ad757b4 - "feat(tasks): implement enhanced TaskWarrior completion flow (#31)"

## Next Steps
When continuing, implement the state update prompt:
1. After task completion, check if contact's current state relates to the task
2. Prompt user: "Update contact state from 'followup' to 'ok'? (y/n)"
3. Update state if confirmed

## Code Context
- Main changes in `internal/tui/app.go` (task completion mode handling)
- TaskWarrior backend updated in `internal/tasks/taskwarrior/backend.go`
- Task completion mode handler is at the top of Update() function

## Fixed Issue (2025-06-18)
State update prompt wasn't appearing because the code was using the wrong contact reference in task mode:
- Was using `m.selected` index from contact list
- Fixed by adding `taskViewContactID` to track which contact's tasks are being viewed
- Now uses `GetContact(ID)` instead of selected index
- Properly stores/clears contact ID when entering/exiting task mode

The enhanced TaskWarrior completion flow with state updates is now fully functional.
